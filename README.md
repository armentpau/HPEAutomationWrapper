# HPEAutomationWrapper

The HPEAutomation Wrapper project is meant to provide a wrapper around multiple HPE modules to simplify the management of HPE C-Series and HPE Synergy series machines that are connected to OneView appliances.

This code is going to evolve over time and functionality will be limited especially at first.  Feedback is welcome.
